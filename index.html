        <h2>üìñ My Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I was born in the Philippines ‚Äì Metro Manila at the Chinese General Hospital on September 7, 2004, into a strict but caring and supportive family. 
            As a child, I was energetic, often playing outside with friends. While I struggled with memorizing speeches, I learned to improvise and worked hard to succeed. 
            My childhood revolved around spending hours on my computer, playing basketball, and enjoying time with my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. 
        </p>
        <p>
            School was challenging, especially public speaking due to my low self-esteem. Over time, I overcame my fear and grew more confident. I looked up to LeBron James as a role model 
            because of his perseverance and work ethic. My grandfather also taught me important life lessons, like embracing failure, forgiveness, and avoiding hatred. 
            Initially, I dreamed of becoming an engineer, but I later discovered my talent for computers, leading me to pursue BSIT.
        </p>
        <p>
            My teenage years were a time of growth, new friendships, and learning from mistakes. High school introduced me to robotics, cooking, and basketball clubs. 
            I enjoyed programming small robots and started considering IT as a career. I also learned time management, balancing gaming and studies effectively. 
            Senior high school marked a pivotal moment when I finally decided to take BSIT at the University of the East.
        </p>
        <p>
            College life was intimidating at first‚Äînew faces, serious professors, and complex coursework. However, I quickly adapted, made friends, and embraced the challenges. 
            The Christmas lighting event at UE became a memorable experience. Professors changed my perspective on computer studies, and I worked hard to pass all my finals during my first year. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, as a second-year BSIT student, I‚Äôve learned multiple programming languages like Python, Java, C#, MySQL, and am currently mastering HTML and CSS. 
            College has been more than just academics‚Äîit has shaped my personal growth and deepened my passion for technology. I am ready to face future challenges, 
            learn from my mistakes, and push my limits to achieve my dreams.

        <h2>üíª My Skills</h2>
        <p>
            As a second-year BSIT student at the University of the East, I have gained experience in several programming languages and technologies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python ‚Äì My first programming language; helped me develop problem-solving and debugging skills.</li>
            <li>Java ‚Äì Strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming.</li>
            <li>MySQL ‚Äì Allowed me to manage databases efficiently for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data.</li>
            <li>C# ‚Äì Expanded my knowledge of game development and software programming.</li>
            <li>HTML & CSS ‚Äì Currently learning to improve my web development skills.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I have already built a simple prototype enrollment system website using HTML. Debugging and troubleshooting have strengthened my logical thinking, 
            and I enjoy working on projects with classmates. As I continue learning, I aim to specialize in backend development and mobile app development, 
            using frameworks like Flutter and React Native.
